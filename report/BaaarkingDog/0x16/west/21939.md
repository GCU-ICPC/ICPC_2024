## 1. Code
 ```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

set<pair<int, int>> level;		// 난이도순 정렬을 위해 set 사용
map <int, int> dict;	// (난이도, 문제)

int main() {
	ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);

	int n;
	cin >> n;

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int p, l;
		cin >> p >> l;
		level.insert({ l,p });
		dict[p] = l;
	}

	int m;
	cin >> m;
	while (m--) {
		string op;
		cin >> op;

		if (op == "recommend") {
			int x;
			cin >> x;

			if (x == 1) {
				cout << (*prev(level.end())).second << '\n';
			}
			else if (x == -1) {
				cout << (*level.begin()).second << '\n';
			}

		}
		else if (op == "add") {
			int p, l;
			cin >> p >> l;
			level.insert({ l,p });
			dict[p] = l;
		}
		else if (op == "solved") {
			int p;
			cin >> p;

			level.erase({ dict[p], p});
			dict.erase(p);
		}
	}
}

## 3. Approach
### Explanation for Psuedo code
**how to approach**   
When inserting values, `set` was used by paying attention to the characteristic of `set` that aligns in ascending order.   

After saving all the values, you can process the input commands one by one.   

`recommend 1` and `-1` can be approached at the back and front of the `set` using `end` and `begin` interators, respectively.   

When processing `solved`, `(difficulty, problem number)` should be handed over to the parameters of the `erase` method. However, only the problem number is entered by the user. Therefore, it is necessary to use `map` to get the difficulty for a specific problem stored in advance.

***

## 4. Analysis
### Correctness
In the case of `recommend 1`, the number of the problem with the highest difficulty must be output. If the most difficult problem is multiple, the problem number should be printed out as large.
Therefore, when saving the value in `set`, store it in the order of `(problem number, difficulty)` instead of **`(problem number, difficulty)`**. This is because, according to the nature of `pair`, the values of `first` are sorted in ascending order and then the values of `second` are sorted in ascending order. (*I missed this point and output the wrong value.*)

### Performance
Time complexity of `map` increases to $O(N)$ at worst case, but `set` is always $O(logN)$.

## 5. Future Work
There are no more better codes.
