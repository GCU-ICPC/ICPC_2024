## 1. Code
 ```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);
	
	int N;
	cin >> N;

	queue<int> q1;

	for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
		q1.push(i);
	}

	while (q1.size() > 1) {
		q1.pop();

		int temp = q1.front();
		q1.pop();
		q1.push(temp);
	}
	cout << q1.front();
}
 ```

## 2. output
 ```cpp
// input
6
```

```cpp
// output
4
```

## 3. Approach
### Pseudo code
```
procedure findLast{
	N := input integer
	q1 := queue which has 1 to N

	while size of q1 > 1
		delete front of q1

		temp := front of q1
		delete front of q1
		insert temp at back of q1
	print front of q1
}
```
### Explanation for Psuedo code
**how to approach**   
`For example, let's consider that N=4. The cards sit in the order of 1234 from the top. If you discard 1, 234 remains. If you move 2 to the bottom, you get 342. If you throw away 3, you get 42, and if you move 4 down, you get 24. Finally, if you throw away 2, you get 4.`   
*I extracted the question for an easy explanation.*

Therefore, if you pop the front, $2$ is the front. Save $2$ to `temp`, pop the front once more, and insert `temp` at the end of the queue.
Repeat this until the size of the queue reaches $1$, and the last remaining element of the queue is output.

## 4. Analysis
### Correctness
If you set the condition of the while statement to `q1.size == 1`, you will get an error. Because you pop twice within the while statement, the size of `q1` must be greater than $1$.

## 5. Future Work
There are no more better codes.
