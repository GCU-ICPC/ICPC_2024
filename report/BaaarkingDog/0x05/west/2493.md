## 1. Code
 ```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);

	int N;
	cin >> N;

	stack<int> val;
	stack<int> idx;

	val.push(100000001);
	idx.push(0);

	for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
		int k = 0;
		cin >> k;

		// delete
		/*
			1000000010 6 9 5 7 4
			9앞에 있는 6은 삭제
		*/
		while (val.top() < k) {
			val.pop();
			idx.pop();
		}
		// print
		cout << idx.top() << " ";
		// push
		val.push(k);
		idx.push(i);
	}
}
 ```

## 3. Approach
### Pseudo code
```
procedure See{
    N := the number of tops
    val := stack which has height of each tops
    idx := stacck which has the number of other tops that itself can see
	
    // criteria
    val.push(100000001);
	idx.push(0);

    for i := 0 to n-1
        K := height of top
        while top of val < k
            delete top of val, idx
        print the number of other tops that itself can see
	insert k at top of val
    insert i at top of idx

}
```
### Explanation for Psuedo code
**how to approach**   
First, insert the value that serves as the reference for comparison into the stack. *{100000001, 1}*   
Repeat the procedure $N$ times using the `for` statement.   
Each time the for statement is repeated, a new integer `k` is entered.   
Then, through `while(...)`, if the newly input integer is less than the value of top, it continues to pop.
If it leaves `while(...)`, print the top of the `idx` stack and insert `k` and `i` into each stack.
***

## 4. Analysis
### Correctness
The for statement `i` starts at $1$ because the height of the tower is greater than $0$.   

When a new value is input, if it is larger than the existing value, the existing value is deleted. In the end, the stacks are sorted in **ascending order**.

## 5. Future Work
I think it would be more convenient to use a pair than to make two stacks.
